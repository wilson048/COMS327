This homework required by the class COM S 327 is a program that will allow the user to move the player on the board.
Each time the player moves, the path map gradients are regenerated and all eligible NPCs take their turn.
When the player tries to touch a trainer or a trainer touches the player, a battle is initated. The player can now enter the Pokemon facilites located on the map. The player can additionally move to other maps, either by moving through a gate or by flying to a location within the 401 x 401 world.

This program will be converted to C++ with a full port of all the major structs like map_t, character_t, pc_t, and npc_t being converted to classes.
For whatever reason, moving diagonally into a gate where its adjacent map isn't generated causes the game to completely freeze so be wary when moving towards gates to new maps.
