This homework required by the class COM S 327 is a program that places NPCs on map and makes them move accordingly from movement cost.
The movement for each turn will be gauged by a priority queue for all NPCs located on the grid where different NPCs will move in different ways.
The -numtrainers flag take a range of NPCs from 1-19 and displays an error message if the number is outside those bounds.
Sometimes an NPC will freeze up, sometimes it will segmentation fault, and sometimes they will all freeze, but if that doesn't happen, then everything moves as normal.
