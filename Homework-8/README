This homework required by the class COMS327 is a program
that loads pokemon and generates them randomly on numerous places. 
Pokemon can be generated when encountering grass, or when fighting other trainers. 
The PC for now will automatically spawn with at least one pokemon and a place holder 
during battles with display all the pokemon stats.

Note that the shiny number is 69 and that males are 0 and females are 1.

Press m to level up all pokemon in the pc's party and press r to display all pokemon in the player's party.
Note that the terminal cannot fit all 6 pokemon at once if the pc has that many pokemon, so extend the terminal to see all of them.

I can't get it to not crash upon exit as adding pokemon to all characters seems to mess up a lot of things.
