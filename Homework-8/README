This homework required by the class COMS327 is a program
that loads pokemon and generates them randomly on numerous places. 
Pokemon can be generated when encountering grass, or when fighting other trainers. 
The PC for now will automatically spawn with at least one pokemon and a place holder 
during battles with display all the pokemon stats.

Note that the shiny number is 69.
