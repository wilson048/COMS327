This homework required by the class COMS327 is a program
that allows the player to battle with other trainers in the game, much 
like the mainline pokemon games with many features such as fight, bag, pokemon switch, and fleeing.

To use the sub menus within the pokemon battles and the bag, use the up arrow key to move up the list
and the down arrow key to move down the list. Press enter on the keyboard in order to select an option.

Note that the game may freeze on rare occurances when moving into different maps. These occurences have been pretty rare though.
